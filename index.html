            <p>
                It's been a month since you came into my life,<br>
                A gentle spark that set my world alight.<br>
                In every moment, there's a trace of you,<br>
                A whisper of a dream that's coming true.<br><br>
        
                Your laughter, like a melody, so sweet,<br>
                Echoes in my heart, a joyful beat.<br>
                Your smile, a sunrise in the morning light,<br>
                Guides me through the day, so warm and bright.<br><br>
        
                In every glance, I see a future there,<br>
                A place where we can shed our every care.<br>
                Your presence, like a gentle, calming breeze,<br>
                Brings comfort, puts my restless soul at ease.<br><br>
        
                A month may seem so brief, so short a time,<br>
                Yet in your gaze, I've found a perfect rhyme.<br>
                With every day, my feelings grow and bloom,<br>
                A garden of affection, full and true.<br><br>
        
                In shadows deep, where light had scarce a trace,<br>
                You found me there, in a dark, silent place.<br>
                With gentle words, you pulled me from despair,<br>
                And showed me love, a reason to repair.<br><br>
        
                The road ahead, a path yet to explore,<br>
                With hints of roses knocking at your door.<br>
                A journey lies, with secret steps to take,<br>
                Unspoken words, decisions yet to make.<br><br>
        
                So here's to you, the one who's captured me,<br>
                In just a month, you've made my heart believe.<br>
                In love's sweet song, we are the melody,<br>
                A tune of joy, of hope, of destiny.<br><br>
        
                As we journey on, one month and more to come,<br>
                Know that with you, my heart is truly home.<br>
                For in this month, you've been my saving grace,<br>
                A love that fills my life with light and grace.<br>
            </p>
